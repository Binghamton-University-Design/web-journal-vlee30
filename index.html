					<h2>A Visual Message for the Inhabitants of Other Celestial Bodies</h2>

					</div>
					
					<p>For Project 1, we were challenged to create a plaque design to be mounted on a rocket sent into space. If other celestial bodies were to stumble upon this, what would they learn about humankind?</p>
					
					<p>Coming up with the design and components that I wanted to showcase began with the idea of philosophy. Specifically, the philosophical statement by Ren√© Descartes of Cogito, ergo sum aka "I think, therefore I am". In my opinion, the human brain is one of the most complex and interesting things about us. Humans are thinking creatures with feelings, morals and values which makes us all unique individuals.</p>

					<p>I wanted to represent this idea as a technical drawing. Starting with the skull as the housing of our brain. Next, I created zoomed in portions of the brain located within the skull showcasing two different perspectives. Following that is a zoomed in portion of the brain, specifically the neurons and synapses. This could be interpreted as the place where connections are made, both literally and figuratively. Literally, the neurons are sent through the synapses and figuratively, since human connections are made everyday. The visual hierarchy of my project is that similar to a pyramid. The largest portion as the skull at the top and each layer is a zoomed in portion of the previous layer. They are connected by lines to further communicated that idea.</p>
